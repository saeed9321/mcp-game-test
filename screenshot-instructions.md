# Screenshot Instructions

To add the actual screenshot of your game to the README:

1. Save the screenshot from this conversation:

    - Look for the "MCP Resources" (paperclip icon) in this chat
    - Find the screenshot labeled "research://screenshots/2"
    - Download this image to your computer

2. Rename the downloaded image to `game-screenshot.png`

3. Place the image in the screenshots folder:

    ```bash
    # From your repository directory
    # Make sure the screenshots directory exists
    mkdir -p screenshots

    # Move your screenshot to the screenshots directory
    mv /path/to/downloaded/game-screenshot.png screenshots/

    # Add and commit the changes
    git add screenshots/game-screenshot.png
    git commit -m "Add game screenshot in screenshots folder"
    git push origin master
    ```

4. The README will now display the actual screenshot of your game

Note: If you prefer, you can also upload the screenshot directly through the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/saeed9321/mcp-game-test
2. Navigate to the "screenshots" folder (create it if it doesn't exist)
3. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
4. Drag and drop your screenshot (named `game-screenshot.png`)
5. Commit the changes
