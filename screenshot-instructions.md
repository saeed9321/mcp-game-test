# Screenshot Instructions

To add the actual screenshot of your game to the README:

1. Save the screenshot from this conversation:

    - Look for the "MCP Resources" (paperclip icon) in this chat
    - Find the screenshot labeled "research://screenshots/2"
    - Download this image to your computer

2. Rename the downloaded image to `game-screenshot.png`

3. Upload the image to your repository:

    ```bash
    # From your repository directory
    git add game-screenshot.png
    git commit -m "Add game screenshot"
    git push origin master
    ```

4. The README will now display the actual screenshot of your game

Note: If you prefer, you can also upload the screenshot directly through the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/saeed9321/mcp-game-test
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop your screenshot (named `game-screenshot.png`)
4. Commit the changes
